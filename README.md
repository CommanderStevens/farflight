#Far Flight

Flight as far as you can without crashing. You can play it [here](http://edwrodrig.github.io/farflight/).

##Description
**Far Flight** is a simple serverless *javascript* game that simulates 3d using *canvas* 2d context primitives. It's the final stage of several graphical demos originally programmed in *C++* using *Allegro* and then ported to *javascript*. Some of this demos are published in the following links:
* [Isometric Rotation](http://codepen.io/edwrodrig/pen/ynfJo)
* [Fast Flight - Game Edition](http://codepen.io/edwrodrig/pen/KgbAt)

##Usage
Just download and open *demo.html* in a browser, it is the minimal html code to include the game. Translations are in the *js/locale* folder so include what you want.

##Contributing
Feel free to fork and pull requests. If you find a error you're welcome to fix it. I'm not a web compatibility enthusiast so I think there are many cross-browser issues and unhandled errors. Also you can contribute making new translations. If you have an idea of gameplay please contact me.
